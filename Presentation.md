Notes
=====
+ Our features work really well by themselves, but once they're integrated each other, things tend to break. 
+ We chose a really difficult task. This is the reason why there's nothing like BesserNote out there. It's a recursive note-taking program that gives users the power to organize their notes. Maybe too much power.
+ The recursive and open-ended nature of our program are the coolest part of our program. 



Presentation Outline (Macro View -> Process of building it -> Fancy Demo -> Division of features/showing them off -> Talk about future goals) 
==========================================
1. Talk about ideas and goals. Built off user survey ideas. Flexibility, keyboard shortcuts, organization, many plugins.
2. Talk about why they were hard to accomplish, and what kind of difficulties we encountered.
3. Demo with big pre-made thing. 
4. Talk about how we divided labor.
5. Show off individual features, since they work better by themselves.
6. The future: once we have a solid core, it's easy to make plugins since everything is recursive.
