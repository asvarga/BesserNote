Notes
=====
+ Our features work really well by themselves, but once they're integrated each other, things tend to break. 
+ We chose a really difficult task. This is the reason why there's nothing like BesserNote out there. It's a recursive note-taking program that gives users the power to organize their notes. Maybe too much power.
+ The recursive and open-ended nature of our program are the coolest part of our program. 



iPresentation Outline (Macro View -> Process of building it -> Fancy Demo -> Division of features/showing them off -> Talk about future goals) 
==========================================
1. Talk about ideas and goals. Built off user survey ideas. Flexibility, keyboard shortcuts, organization, many plugins.
2. Talk about why they were hard to accomplish, and what kind of difficulties we encountered.
3. Demo with big pre-made thing. 
4. Talk about how we divided labor.
5. Show off individual features, since they work better by themselves.
6. The future: once we have a solid core, it's easy to make plugins since everything is recursive.

Overview
========

--David-- (Intro : About 2 mins)

I'll start with an overview of our software and how it came to be. Even though we spend most of our time on our computers, a good deal of us still take notes with an old-fashioned pen and paper. For us, it was because we thought the things you can do with note-takin software is pretty limited. Even the best software out there limits you to fixed lines and rigid structure.

We wondered if other people thought the same way, so we conducted surveys, each of us with about 15 friends. Among the 45, very few said they took notes with their computer, and among those who did, virtually none of them were satisfied with their current software. Common complaints were inability to organize things how they wanted, inability to draw, and clunky interfaces. 

We built BesserNote with these feature at the core. We wanted user flexibility and a departure from the normal note-taking paradigm of just pages of notes. We wanted to build a visual interface where users organized their notes how they want, were able to perform a variety of useful operations, and could do all of this with relative ease.

Talk about higher level, what difficulties we encountered:
- LibGDX
- Switching to JavaFX/Java8
- JavaFX basics: what a scene graph is
- Why integrating things together was hard
 	- Even though it looks like we just have a front-end, we have a very robust backend
	- We basically made a meta GUI

--Dan-- (Demo: About 2 mins)
Show off demo
- Don't need to show off what individual features are, but go through the thing and show JJ how what we built is really applicable for the use case of a typical college student.

Individual features

--David-- (Conclusion)

We chose a challenging project and we think we've built the core for what will one day be the best note-taking software out there. If you had to sum up our program in a sentence, it's recursive note-taking software with features and flexibility. Because it's recursive, it will be pretty easy to write plugins for the future that appeal to individual uses cases. For example, most STEM people don't take notes on their computer because they need to draw or write formulas; we could make plugins for that. Honestly, there are still some bugs that we need to iron out in the core, but we hope you see how useful and powerful BesserNote is and will be. We really enjoyed making this and learned a lot, thanks for your time.
