Looks like we aren't going to fail. According to our TAs, the only feature that we're really missing is image stuff.

TODO: Basically, make it more usable.
=====================================
- Insert images. //ALMOST DONE
   - For some reason, it's not resizable. The size comes off as 0.
- Decide what to do about rich text. 
   - Being able to make outlines would be really good, almost essential.
- Flashcard binders?
- Make deleting text not delete the entire node. //DONE
- Make resizing and moving not rely on click. //DONE
- Make insertion smarter: don't need to have a box highlighted.
- Keyboard shortcuts.  //DONE
- Either make drawing work or take it out. //DONE: took it out
- Improve tutorial (doesn't matter that much, since JJ won't be using our program, anyways).

High-level description of program
=================================

Vim with the flexibility of MS paint?

I really liked how Vinh described our program as a "recursive notetaking program" because that's really what makes it different. EVerything is part of a graph, and it's all pretty generic. It's easily modifiable, the UI is clean, and it really gives the user a lot of flexibility. It's also easy for us to build powerful plugins.

The pitch
=========
1. Make a sexy-looking document and present it.

2. Build something up from scratch to show JJ how it works.

3. Demonstrate saving and loading.

4. Explain how we plan to build this up even further, with plugins. BesserNote is the base. Because it's recursive and generic, it can be modified very easily. We could even make an API so that other people could develop for BesserNote. Ideas:
 - Orgo thing
 - Outlines
 - Graphs
 - Parse LaTeX?
